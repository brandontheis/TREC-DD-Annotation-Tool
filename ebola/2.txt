The length of time between exposure to the virus and the development of symptoms (incubation period) is between 2 to 21 days.[1][12] Most often this is between 4 to 10 days.[13] However, recent estimates based on mathematical models predict that around 5% of cases may take greater than 21 days to develop.[14]

Symptoms usually begin with a sudden influenza-like stage characterized by feeling tired, fever, weakness, decreased appetite, muscle pain, joint pain, headache, and sore throat.[1][13][15][16] The fever is usually higher than 38.3 °C (100.9 °F).[17] This is often followed by vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain.[16] Next, shortness of breath and chest pain may occur, along with swelling, headaches and confusion.[16] In about half of the cases, the skin may develop a maculopapular rash (a flat red area covered with small bumps), which may be seen 5 to 7 days after symptoms begin.[13][17]

In some cases, internal and external bleeding may occur.[1] This typically begins five to seven days after the first symptoms.[18] All infected people show some decreased blood clotting.[17] Bleeding from mucous membranes or from sites of needle punctures has been reported in 40–50 percent of cases.[19] This may result in the vomiting of blood, coughing up of blood, or the presence of blood in stool.[20] Bleeding into the skin may create petechiae, purpura, ecchymoses or hematomas (especially around needle injection sites).[21] Bleeding into the whites of the eyes may also occur. Heavy bleeding is uncommon, and if it occurs, it is usually located within the gastrointestinal tract.[17][22]

Recovery may begin between 7 and 14 days after first symptoms.[16] Death, if it occurs, follows typically 6 to 16 days from first symptoms and is often due to low blood pressure from fluid loss.[2] In general, bleeding often indicates a worse outcome, and this blood loss may result in death.[15] People are often in a coma near the end of life.[16] Those who survive often have ongoing muscle and joint pain, liver inflammation, decreased hearing, and may have constitutional symptoms such as feeling tired, continued weakness, decreased appetite, and difficulty returning to pre-illness weight.[16][23] Additionally they develop antibodies against Ebola that last at least 10 years but it is unclear if they are immune to repeated infections.[24] If someone survives Ebola, they can no longer transmit the disease.[24]
