Infection control

Unlike today, it was not always common for health care workers to wear protective clothing, as evidenced by this worker from the CDC with an Ebola patient.
People who care for those infected with Ebola should wear protective clothing including masks, gloves, gowns and goggles.[82] The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommend that the protective gear leaves no skin exposed.[83] These measures are also recommended for those who may handle objects contaminated by an infected person's body fluids.[84] In 2014, the CDC began recommending that medical personnel receive training on the proper suit-up and removal of personal protective equipment (PPE); in addition, a designated person, appropriately trained in biosafety, should be watching each step of these procedures to ensure they are done correctly.[83] In Sierra Leone, the typical training period for the use of such safety equipment lasts approximately 12 days.[85]

The infected person should be in barrier-isolation from other people.[82] All equipment, medical waste, patient waste and surfaces that may have come into contact with body fluids need to be disinfected.[84] During the 2014 outbreak, kits were put together to help families treat Ebola disease in their homes, which include protective clothing as well as chlorine powder and other cleaning supplies.[86] Education of those who provide care in these techniques, and the provision of such barrier-separation supplies has been a priority of Doctors Without Borders.[87]

Ebolaviruses can be eliminated with heat (heating for 30 to 60 minutes at 60 Â°C or boiling for 5 minutes). To disinfect surfaces, some lipid solvents such as some alcohol-based products, detergents, sodium hypochlorite (bleach) or calcium hypochlorite (bleaching powder), and other suitable disinfectants may be used at appropriate concentrations.[51][88] Education of the general public about the risk factors for Ebola infection and of the protective measures individuals may take to prevent infection is recommended by the World Health Organization.[1] These measures include avoiding direct contact with infected people and regular hand washing using soap and water.[89]

Bushmeat, an important source of protein in the diet of some Africans, should be handled and prepared with appropriate protective clothing and thoroughly cooked before consumption.[1] Some research suggests that an outbreak of Ebola disease in the wild animals used for consumption may result in a corresponding human outbreak. Since 2003, such animal outbreaks have been monitored to predict and prevent Ebola outbreaks in humans.[90]
