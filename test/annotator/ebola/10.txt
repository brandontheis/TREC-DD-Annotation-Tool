Standard support

No specific treatment is currently approved.[106] Treatment is primarily supportive in nature.[107] Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves survival.[1] Rehydration may be via the oral or by intravenous route.[107] These measures may include management of pain, nausea, fever and anxiety.[107] The World Health Organization recommends avoiding the use of aspirin or ibuprofen for pain due to the bleeding risk associated with use of these medications.[108]

Blood products such as packed red blood cells, platelets or fresh frozen plasma may also be used.[107] Other regulators of coagulation have also been tried including heparin in an effort to prevent disseminated intravascular coagulation and clotting factors to decrease bleeding.[107] Antimalarial medications and antibiotics are often used before the diagnosis is confirmed,[107] though there is no evidence to suggest such treatment helps. A number of experimental treatments are being studied.

If hospital care is not possible, the World Health Organization has guidelines for care at home that have been relatively successful. In such situations, recommendations include using towels soaked in bleach solutions when moving infected people or bodies and applying bleach on stains. It is also recommended that the caregivers wash hands with bleach solutions and cover their mouth and nose with a cloth.[109]

Intensive care
Intensive care is often used in the developed world.[21] This may include maintaining blood volume and electrolytes (salts) balance as well as treating any bacterial infections that may develop.[21] Dialysis may be needed for kidney failure, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be used for lung dysfunction.[21]

Alternative medicine
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advises people to be careful of advertisements making unverified or fraudulent claims of benefits supposedly gained from various anti-Ebola products.[110] The FDA has already sent out at least one letter of warning to a seller of colloidal silver who made unverified claims of Ebola related benefits, supposedly derived from the use of their products.[111]
