Airborne transmission
Human to human transmission of EBOV through the air has not been reported to occur during EVD outbreaks[3] and airborne transmission has only been demonstrated in very strict laboratory conditions, and then only from pigs to primates but not from primates to primates.[29][35] Spread of EBOV by water or food, other than bushmeat, has also not been observed.[34][35] No spread by mosquitos or other insects has been reported.[34]

The apparent lack of airborne transmission among humans is believed to be due to low levels of the virus in the lungs and other parts of the respiratory system of primates, that are insufficient to cause new infections.[45] A number of studies examining airborne transmission broadly concluded that transmission from pigs to primates could happen without direct contact, because unlike humans and primates, pigs with EVD get very high ebolavirus concentrations in their lungs, and not their bloodstream.[46] Therefore pigs with EVD can spread the disease through droplets in the air or on the ground when they sneeze or cough.[47] By contrast, humans and other primates accumulate the virus throughout their body and specifically in their blood, but not very much in their lungs.[47] It is believed that this is the reason researchers have observed pig to primate transmission without physical contact, but no evidence has been found of primates being infected without actual contact, even in experiments where infected and uninfected primates shared the same air.[46][47]

Initial case

Bushmeat being prepared for cooking in Ghana. In Africa, wild animals including fruit bats are hunted for food and are referred to as bushmeat.[48][49] In equatorial Africa, human consumption of bushmeat has been linked to animal-to-human transmission of diseases, including Ebola.[50]
Although it is not entirely clear how Ebola initially spreads from animals to humans, the spread is believed to involve direct contact with an infected wild animal or fruit bat.[34] Besides bats, other wild animals sometimes infected with EBOV include several monkey species, chimpanzees, gorillas, baboons and duikers.[51]

Animals may become infected when they eat fruit partially eaten by bats carrying the virus.[52] Fruit production, animal behavior and other factors may trigger outbreaks among animal populations.[52]

Evidence indicates that both domestic dogs and pigs can also be infected with EBOV.[53] Dogs do not appear to develop symptoms when they carry the virus, and pigs appear to be able to transmit the virus to at least some primates.[53] Although some dogs in an area in which a human outbreak occurred had antibodies to EBOV, it is unclear whether they played a role in spreading the disease to people.[53]
